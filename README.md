# Finger Drawing App with Hand Gestures ðŸŽ¨ðŸ¤š

A cool real-time finger tracking drawing app using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and Python, where you control the canvas with your hands! Draw with your right hand, and use your left hand to send commandsâ€”like toggling drawing, saving your masterpiece, or clearing the canvasâ€”without touching a single key.

## Features

* **Right Hand Index Finger Drawing**: Draw lines by moving your right handâ€™s index finger.
* **Left Hand Gestures to Control**:

  * **Thumb Up**: Toggle drawing on/off.
  * **Two Fingers Up (Index + Middle)**: Save the current drawing.
  * **Three Fingers Up (Index + Middle + Ring)**: Clear the canvas.
* **Brush size control** with `+` and `-` keys.
* **Color buttons** on screen to select drawing colors by touching them with your finger.
* **Filename input box** for saving images without leaving the app.
* Visual debug overlays for wrist position and finger states.
* Real-time hand landmark visualization using MediaPipe.

## How to Use

1. Run the script, allow webcam access.
2. Use your **right hand** index finger to draw on the screen.
3. Use your **left hand** to:

   * Show **thumb up** to toggle drawing mode on/off.
   * Show **two fingers up** (index + middle) to enter save mode.
   * Show **three fingers up** (index + middle + ring) to clear the canvas.
4. When saving, type the filename and press **Enter**, or press **Esc** to cancel.
5. Use `+` and `-` keys to adjust brush size.
6. Press **Esc** anytime to quit.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* OpenCV (`cv2`)
* MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)
* NumPy

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## How It Works 

* Uses **MediaPipe Hands** to detect hand landmarks.
* Detects finger positions relative to the wrist to decide if fingers are "up" or "down".
* Differentiates right and left hands to assign drawing vs gesture control roles.
* Implements debouncing logic to avoid accidental repeated gestures.
* Combines webcam feed with a transparent canvas layer for smooth drawing.
